## Description

For this project we were given the code to a website. We were asked to refreactor the starter code and clean it up. After the code was refactored (taking out the divs and adding more clear lines of code that did not alter it.) the code was pushed to my github. The website was deployed via github and both github and the website link will be submitted for this project.
